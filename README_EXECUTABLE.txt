Auto Type - Windows Executable
===========================

This folder contains the executable version of Auto Type for Windows.

Usage:
1. Either double-click on 'dist\AutoType-Windows.exe' directly
2. Or use the 'Launch_AutoType.bat' file for easier launching

Note: When running for the first time, Windows might show a security warning.
This is normal for non-signed executables. Click 'More info' and then 'Run anyway'
to proceed.
